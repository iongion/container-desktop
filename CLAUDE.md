## What this is

Cross-platform **Electron desktop app** for managing container engines
(Podman, Docker, and Apple Container — the last is **experimental**, macOS /
Apple-silicon only) — local, remote over SSH, and WSL. All **Node / TypeScript**:

- **App** — Electron main + preload + React renderer
- **Build/dev/release tooling** — a home-grown CLI (`yarn cli`, commander + tsx) in `support/cli/`

## Stack

Electron 43 · React 19 · Vite 8 (rolldown) · TypeScript 6 · Blueprint 6 (UI) ·
Zustand (state) · TanStack Query + Router · @xterm/xterm 6 · bundled monaco · Biome (lint/format).
Node **24.16.0** (`.nvmrc`), **yarn 1.x** (classic). Build/dev/release tooling is a home-grown
TypeScript CLI (commander) run via **tsx**, in `support/cli/` — no Python.

## Layout

- `src/web-app/` — React renderer: `App.tsx`, `stores/` (Zustand state),
  `domain/` (TanStack Query client), `screens/`, `components/`, `hooks/`,
  `Native.ts`, `Environment.ts`
- `src/container-client/` — engine API clients/adapters · `src/utils/` · `src/env/`
  (logging façade lives in `src/platform/logger/`)
- `src/platform/` + `src-tauri/` + `src-wails/` — runtime ports: shared brokers/services live at
  `src/platform/*`; `electron/`, `tauri/` and `wails/` (Go backend) align host, command,
  exec, buses, tray, runtime, AI. Packaging/branding metadata is centralized in `support/app-metadata.cjs`.
- `src/ai-system/` — local-first AI assistant (hexagonal: core/host/runtimes/prompt/ui): local + cloud providers, permission-gated **typed container tools → generative-UI cards**; see [`docs/architecture/ai-subsystem.md`](docs/architecture/ai-subsystem.md).
- `vite.config.{common,main,preload,renderer}.mjs` · `electron-builder-config.cjs`
  · `support/watch.mjs` (dev launcher) · **`support/cli/`** (the `yarn cli` build/dev/release
  tool, commander + tsx) · `Makefile`
- **`website-src/`** — Eleventy sources for the public site (container-desktop.com),
  compiled to the **generated `website/`** (never hand-edit `website/`; see Website below).
- **`docs/`** — architecture docs (C4 diagrams) + contributor guides;
  start at `docs/README.md`.
- Path alias **`@/* → src/*`** (e.g. `@/web-app/...`) plus **`@/cli/* → support/cli/*`** for the
  tooling, defined in `tsconfig.json` `paths` + explicit `resolve.alias` in the common vite config
  (and vitest). `@/cli` must precede `@` in the vite/vitest alias order (first-hit matching).

## Commands

Use the project Node first: `nvm use` (24.16.0). Package manager is **yarn**.

- Install: `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` (or `make prepare`)
- **Verify — run all before claiming done:**
  `yarn check-types` (tsc — app + `support/cli`) · `yarn lint` (Biome; `yarn lint:check` = no-write, used in CI) ·
  `yarn test:run` (Vitest, hermetic) · `yarn build` (main+preload+renderer)
- Keep no node/electron/@tauri leaks in shared `src/` code.
- Dev (hot reload): `yarn dev` · Format: `yarn format`
- Package: `yarn package:linux_x86` (also `mac_arm`/`win_x86`/`linux_arm`);
  full release: `yarn cli release`
- Publish GitHub release assets locally only:
  `yarn cli publish-release --run-id <actions-run-id>` dry-run,
  then add `--perform`. The Microsoft Store wrapper is optional and can be
  copied into `release/container-desktop-installer.exe` when available.
  `CDPipeline.Tauri.yml` (the default release pipeline; `CDPipeline.Electron.yml` /
  `CDPipeline.Wails.yml` are the alternates) can also publish after all production
  targets build; use its `replace-release` input to delete/recreate the same version cleanly.
- **Build/dev/release CLI:** `yarn cli <command>` (commander + tsx; source in `support/cli/`) — the
  home-grown replacement for the old Python `invoke` tasks: `bundle`, `bump`, `sync-manifests`
  (alias `version-sync` — syncs version + shared app metadata from `support/app-metadata.cjs` into the
  derived manifests), `release`, `commit-release`, `publish-release`, `publish-meta`, `fetch-appx`, `checksums`,
  `create-icons`, … (run `yarn cli` to list them). Lint/format the tooling with `make check` /
  `make format` (Biome).
- Linux system deps (one-shot): `bash support/provision-deps.sh`

## Development workflow — TDD + live app, NOT static-checks-at-the-end (non-negotiable)

How you build here, **per change** — not an end-of-task afterthought:

- **Test-first (TDD) for logic.** Failing test → watch it fail for the right reason → minimal
  code to pass. Covers pure/near-pure units: hook helpers, `normalizers/`, `comparators`,
  grouping/flatten, reducers, stores. No production logic without a failing test first — tests
  added after prove nothing. **Never add component tests** for React components/screens/presentational
  UI; verify those live, don't fake them in jsdom.
- **Verify every UI change in the running app, as you go.** Keep `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_MOCK=1 yarn
  dev` hot-reloading and drive `support/cdp.mjs` (screenshot + `EVAL=` asserts) after each
  change — never batch to the end. The renderer is the source of truth.
- **Static checks close out, they aren't the loop.** `check-types`/`lint`/`test:run`/`build`
  never render the UI; run all four (Commands) only to finish, after the app confirms behavior.

## Build / runtime model — READ BEFORE TOUCHING THE BUILD

- **Source is ESM/TypeScript, but main & preload are bundled to CommonJS (`.cjs`).**
  Electron's API is only reachable via the CJS `require` hook here; ESM output
  makes `import { app } from "electron"` fail to link. **Do not switch main/preload
  to ESM output.** The **renderer stays ESM**.
- `__dirname` is native in the CJS main/preload (the common config only maps it to
  `import.meta.dirname` for ESM output).
- **Preload** builds to `build/<version>/preload.cjs`; the renderer blocks on
  `window.Preloaded`, exposed via `contextBridge` in `preload.ts`
  (see `Native.ts:waitForPreload`).
- **Production requires `ENVIRONMENT=production`** (e.g.
  `cross-env ENVIRONMENT=production yarn build`): emits the single-file
  `build/<version>/{main.cjs,preload.cjs,renderer.mjs}` layout and loads the
  packaged renderer over `file://`. `ssh2` is bundled by rolldown `ssr.noExternal`,
  not ncc. Without production env the build defaults to development and tries the
  dev-server URL → blank window when packaged.
- Build target is `es2022`; the renderer uses top-level await — keep target ≥ es2022.

## Website (container-desktop.com) — `website/` IS GENERATED, NEVER EDIT IT

- **Never edit anything under `website/` by hand — it is compiled output, wiped and
  rebuilt on every run.** Edit the **`website-src/`** sources instead (Eleventy:
  `_includes/` layouts, `manual/*.md` guides, `_data/` data, `static/` assets), then
  run **`make build-website`** (or `yarn build:website`; live preview `yarn dev:website`).
- The committed `website/` is exactly what GitHub Pages serves
  (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`). Flow: **edit `website-src/` → `make build-website`
  → commit both `website-src/` and `website/` → push**.
- Versions + per-OS download URLs are injected at build time from `package.json`
  (`website-src/_data/`); never hand-edit a version in the output. The release flow
  (`make release` → `make build-assets`) rebuilds the website so links match the tag.

## Dev launcher (`support/watch.mjs`) & debugging

- Starts the Vite renderer dev server + Electron, rebuilding/respawning on change.
- **GPU flags are gated behind `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_HEADLESS`.** Normal `yarn dev`
  uses safe GPU defaults. Do **not** re-add `--in-process-gpu` /
  `--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor` to the default path — they caused a GPU
  crash-loop that froze the machine. Use `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_HEADLESS=1` only for CI/headless.
- **Never set `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`** when launching the app — Electron then runs
  as plain Node, the `electron` API is missing, and startup fails.
- The renderer is exposed over **CDP on an auto-selected port**: `yarn dev` prefers
  `9222` but **falls back to a free port if it's taken** (e.g. a podman rootless
  port-forward squatting 9222) and writes the live endpoint to
  `$TMPDIR/container-desktop-cdp.json` (also logged as `CDP endpoint: …`). **Don't assume
  9222** — read that file. Force a port with `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT`.
  Bare `http://localhost:3000` won't work — it needs the preload bridge.
- **`support/cdp.mjs`** is the headless CDP driver for verification/screenshots — it
  **attaches** to the already-running dev app (never launches/closes it), settles through
  reloads, prints a structured snapshot (theme/engine/route + per-connection counts &
  runtime from `resource:get-snapshot`), and writes a PNG:
  `node support/cdp.mjs /tmp/app.png '#/screens/containers'`. Env: `RELOAD=1` re-runs the
  renderer bootstrap (initialize → connectAll); `EVAL='<expr>'` runs an expression in the
  page and prints its JSON result (use `EVAL="$(cat file.js)"` for multi-line — incl. async
  IIFEs); it **auto-discovers the port** from that handshake file, and `CDP_URL` overrides
  it. Multi-engine dev: `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_MOCK=1 yarn dev`
  boots Podman+Docker mocks, then drive with this. (See [memory: Verify Electron app via CDP].)
- **NEVER `xvfb-run` or spawn a second app instance to verify the UI.** When a dev app is already
  running (it usually is), **attach** to it via `support/cdp.mjs` on the auto-discovered CDP port — that
  is the required verification path. Do **not** use `xvfb-run`, `launchApp`, or `yarn test:ui` for local
  UI verification; the Electron/xvfb UI suite (`yarn test:ui`) is for CI only, never for iterating here.
- **Tauri build has NO CDP** (WebKitGTK). Drive it over **W3C WebDriver** instead — the Tauri
  equivalent of `support/cdp.mjs`: `yarn test:e2e:tauri` runs `webdriver/wdio.conf.js`
  (WebdriverIO → `tauri-driver` → `WebKitWebDriver` → the app). Prereqs: `tauri-driver`
  (`~/.cargo/bin`) + `webkitgtk-webdriver` (`/usr/bin/WebKitWebDriver`). The harness sets
  `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_E2E=1`, which gates single-instance OFF (lib.rs) so it runs standalone
  next to your dev app. Specs use `browser.execute`/`saveScreenshot`. **Caveat:** the debug
  binary loads `devUrl` :3000 (needs a running vite / `yarn tauri:serve`); point at a
  self-contained release binary via `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_E2E_APP`. **Paint caveat:** WebKitGTK
  parks its compositor when idle, so a WebDriver screenshot can force a paint the live view
  hadn't done — read the DOM to confirm data, use eyes/screenshots for paint.
- **Website capture (screenshots) runs on either shell.** `support/cli/media/screenshots.ts` drives a
  `CaptureDriver` port with two adapters — Playwright/CDP (Electron) and WebdriverIO/WebDriver (Tauri,
  reusing the `test:e2e:tauri` stack). Pick via **`CONTAINER_DESKTOP_CAPTURE_BACKEND=electron|tauri`**
  (**default `tauri`**) or `--backend`; `yarn screenshots:electron` is the comparison shortcut. Both
  backends write the same published `website-src/static/**` images — Tauri (WebKitGTK/WebDriver) is the
  default producer, Electron (Playwright/CDP) the like-for-like comparison. The website **demo** is a
  screenshot slideshow: `yarn screenshots` also writes the per-engine demo manifests
  (`demoManifest.ts` expands `demoScenario.json` → `/replays/<engine>.json`, paged by `demo-replay.js`).
  Tauri needs `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_MOCK=1 yarn tauri:serve` for the debug binary, or a release binary via
  `CONTAINER_DESKTOP_E2E_APP`.
- Kill switch: `pkill -f support/watch.mjs; pkill -f dist/electron`. **Footgun:** never
  run `pkill -f <pattern>` from a one-liner whose own command text contains `<pattern>` —
  it matches and kills its own shell (silent exit 144). Kill by numeric PID instead.

## Conventions

- **Biome only** (`biome.json`) — 2-space indent, double quotes, width 120. Don't
  add ESLint/Prettier. `yarn lint` auto-fixes.
- TypeScript strict (`noImplicitAny: false`). `tsconfig.json` uses `paths` (no
  `baseUrl` — removed in TS 6) and `types: ["node"]`.
- **No raw NUL bytes in code.** Never insert literal/invisible NUL bytes into source
  files. If code needs a NUL separator, write the visible escape sequence `\u0000`;
  do not type, paste, or copy the raw byte itself into a string, because it makes
  Git/editor tooling treat the file as binary.
- **Comments:** use `//` in TypeScript/JavaScript source; keep JSX `{/* ... */}` and
  `biome-*` directive comments as required by tooling/syntax. Do not add C-style
  block comments, CSS comments, XML comments, or comments that explain historical /
  legacy migrations; delete stale history instead of preserving it.
- **Dependencies are pinned to exact versions** in `package.json` — don't
  reintroduce `^`/`~` ranges casually.
- **Transitive security pins live in `package.json` `resolutions`** (dompurify,
  lodash, fast-uri, @xmldom/xmldom, tmp). Fix a transitive
  advisory by adding/adjusting a resolution there, then update and review `yarn.lock`.
- **`npm audit` is unreliable here** — it mis-evaluates yarn `resolutions` (reports
  already-patched versions as vulnerable). Verify by the **installed** version
  (`node -p "require('<pkg>/package.json').version"`), not by `npm audit`.
  `minimatch`/`picomatch` ReDoS advisories are build-tooling-only (not shipped) and
  now have in-range patches — pulled in by refreshing the lockfile entry, not a
  `resolution`. Only their breaking majors are blocked (see dependabot, below).
- **Tests:** a hermetic **Vitest** suite (`yarn test:run`) runs the renderer +
  container-client under plain Node via `src/__tests__/setup/` (headless globals + a recording
  `fakeCommand`); `*.live.test.ts` + `installRealCommand()` are reserved for a future real-VM
  suite (no separate config yet). The `support/cli/` tooling has its own Vitest specs
  (`support/cli/**/*.test.ts`, included in `yarn test:run`). CI
  gate: `.github/workflows/CIPipeline.yml`. Details: [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).
- **UI changes:** verify live in the running app, not off static checks — see Development workflow.
- **Logging:** use `@/platform/logger` (`createLogger`), never raw `console.*` (except the façade
  sink + the pre-React fallback in `index.tsx`). Verbosity is controlled solely by log level.

## UI conventions (renderer · Blueprint)

The user is a hands-on designer and corrects deviations fast — match these up front:

- **Theme tokens — never hardcode colors/spacing.** Read the `--app-*` vars from
  `src/web-app/themes/tokens.css` (`--app-chrome` receding nav/sidebar · `--app-bg`
  content · `--app-surface` cards/header · `--app-surface-strong` table headers ·
  `--app-border` hairline · `--app-text`/`--app-text-muted` · `--app-accent*`) so UI
  tracks every engine×mode. A hardcoded `rgba()`/hex (or an invented var) looks foreign.
  Match the app's content rhythm (`.AppScreen` 10px pad; generous panel padding); a
  sub-nav rail reuses the `AppSidebar` vertical `ButtonGroup` idiom and recedes via
  `--app-chrome`.
- **Confirmations:** reuse `ConfirmMenu` (inline Yes/No popover), never `Alert`/dialogs.
- **Icons:** must read bright/white in dark theme (muted `#abb3bf` looks disabled); use
  `Icon`'s `color` prop for state colors.
- **Tables:** selection checkbox in the **last** column (first breaks the grouped/tree
  view); trailing columns shrink-to-fit. Selection is **always-on** (action bar shows
  when ≥1 selected).
- **CHANGELOG:** terse one-liners. **Activity log:** response bodies + CLI output only
  for **failed** calls.

## Working agreements

- Branch off `main`; don't commit directly. Keep commits scoped; no co-author or
  tooling attribution trailers.
- After changes, actually run the verify commands and report real output — never
  claim success unverified.
- Long-running steps (packaging, dev run) → run in the background; don't block.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` groups minor/patch bumps weekly per ecosystem
  (npm / github-actions); **major bumps are never auto-proposed** (ignored
  globally) — adopt majors deliberately by hand.
- Build/release automation must use lockfile-respecting installs
  (`yarn install --frozen-lockfile`) and pinned tool/action versions. Do not use
  `@latest` or floating GitHub Actions tags.
